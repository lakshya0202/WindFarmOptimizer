# WindFarmOptimizer
This project was made possible because of my participation in the hackathon conducted by Shell.
This code was our team's attempt at optimizing positioning of 50 wind turbines in a field of given dimensions such that the Annual Energy Production (AEP) is maximum. Wind directions for 7 years were provided to us as the learning data.
Though we did not win the competition, it gave me a good insight to how Genetic Algorithms work, and how ML can be applied to so many things of day to day importance.
I believe the algorithm we used got stuck at a local optimum and was unable to make much changes from the given point without decreasing the Annual Energy Production Output.
Any feedback on improving the code is appreciated!
